# Beat Dodge
A game I made to learn about musical analysis with an implementation of a Fast Fourier transform algorithm.
Relevant code for FFT and analysis can be found in SoundManager.cpp

## Dependencies
- libsfml-dev
- libmpg123-dev

## Building
Run `make`

## Running
Run `beat-dodge xyz.mp3` where xyz is the mp3 file to analyze.
